# wasm-ffi
#### A lightweight foreign function interface library for JavaScript & WebAssembly

This is a fork of Sterling DeMille's awesome [wasm-ffi](https://github.com/DeMille/wasm-ffi) package.

It provides the following extensions for Julia code:

* `ffi.julia32.Array`
* `ffi.julia32.Tuple`
* `ffi.julia32.Pointer`
* `ffi.julia32.Struct`
* `ffi.julia32.MallocArray`     (from [StaticTools](https://github.com/brenhinkeller/StaticTools.jl))

`julia32` is for interfacing with code generated by a 32-bit version of Julia. This works the best because WebAssembly is a 32-bit system. `julia64` versions of all of these are also provided to interface with code generated by a 64-bit version of Julia.


Here is an example of how to initialize an array in JavaScript. 
```js
var N = 100;
var x  = new ffi.julia32.Array('f64', 1, new Float64Array(N));
```
The arguments are:

* Element type: `'f64'`  
* Number of dimensions: `1`
* A JavaScript typed array to hold the contents: `new Float64Array(N)`

Here is the JavaScript type definition for the variable `x`.

```js
ffi.julia32.Array(`f64`, 1)
```

For multidimensional arrays, another argument at the end is needed to specify `size`:

```js
var y  = new ffi.julia32.Array('f64', 2, new Float64Array(6), [2,3]);
```

Another change from the original wasm-ffi package is that array constructors have a third argument to specify alignment. This is necessary for some 32-bit code.

To build the packaged JavaScript files, run `npx webpack` in this folder. 
To initialize NPM stuff, run `npm install`.
